# Chataway

Continuing my efforts to build up a portfolio of programming projects, I decided
to create Chataway, an effortlessly simple way to chat. Chat rooms are created
on-the-fly by going to the root URL.

I've only begun to explore this idea, and there's lots of work that needs to be 
done if somebody wants to turn this into a real product.

The code is yours to do as you wish and is under MIT License.
